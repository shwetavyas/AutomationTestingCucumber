# AutomationTestingCucumber
Automation Testing Scripts to test an eCommerce website   

This project was developed as an academic project for Software Quality Assurance course at Illinois State University.

We chose Nordstrom.com to write automation test scripts using Selenium Web Driver and Cucumber (Behavior Driven Development).

Below are the functionalities which we have automated in this project:

Sign-up process for all the users.
Sign-in process for all the users.
Validation of location based on the zipcode through Google Maps API.
Searching an item in shopping cart.
Applying various sorting criteria for searching and sorting items.
Adding one and multiple items in shopping cart.
Check out the shopping cart items.
Adding an appointment with personal stylist.

Through this project, I understood the concept of handling dynamic X-Paths, switching iFrames, data driven testing, implicit and explicit wait. Moreover, I gained an expertise in writing automation testing scripts using Selenium web driver and Cucumber.
